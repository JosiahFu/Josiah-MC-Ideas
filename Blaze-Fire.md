# Blaze Fire

- Blaze Powder can be placed on the ground
- Place blaze powder can be lit with flint and steel
- Burning blaze powder produces Blaze Fire, a new fire type
- Blaze Fire burns itself out eventually like normal fire, but unlike normal fire it does not spread to other blocks
  - This is useful if you want to set an enemy on fire but don't want to burn your house down
- Blaze Fire will burn forever if it is placed on netherrack or magma blocks
- Blazes and blaze fireballs display blaze fire, and fireballs will place blaze fire
- An ender pearl dropped above blaze fire (e.g. with a trapdoor) will be converted to an eye of ender 
  - Average of 1.2 pearls can be converted before the fire burns out
