# Wither Expansion

The Wither. It is the source of the all-powerful beacon, but it requires a long grind for skulls, and the fight itself is not very fun. This update aims to mend that.

## Wither Skeleton Skull Piece

The first step is to make the process of acquiring skulls less grindy. Wither skeletons, instead of having a 2% chance of skull drop, will have a 20% chance of dropping one skull piece.

There are 9 unique skull pieces, and you need one of each to craft a single skull. The goal of this is to feel a sense of progress, instead of just rolling the dice until you get a skull, you know you still need a left jaw, a right cheekbone, and a center cranium.

This lowers the average wither skeleton kills per skull to 45 (5 x 9), which seems fair.
