# Wither Expansion

The Wither. It is the source of the all-powerful beacon, but it requires a long grind for skulls, and the fight itself is not very fun. This update aims to mend that.

## Wither Skeleton Skull Piece

The first step is to make the process of acquiring skulls less grindy. Wither skeletons, instead of having a 2% chance of skull drop, will have a 20% chance of dropping one skull piece.

There are 9 unique skull pieces, and you need one of each to craft a single skull. The goal of this is to feel a sense of progress, instead of just rolling the dice until you get a skull, you know you still need a left jaw, a right cheekbone, and a center cranium.

This lowers the average wither skeleton kills per skull to 45 (5 x 9), which seems fair.

## Withered Shrine

Once you've got your three skulls, you can't just place down a wither wherever you want. What fun would that be?

The next step is to find a withered shrine, a new structure that generates in crimson forests, warped forests, and basalt deltas. This is intended to promote exploration and make it feel more like an adventure.

The withered shrine is an ancient structure made of obsidian bricks and wither bone blocks. There is a pedestal in the center and four torch-style pillars (basically a soul soil on top of a pillar).

Placing a skull on the center pedestal and lighting all four torches would initiate the miniboss fight.

## Wither Miniboss

> WIP

Name suggestions welcome.

### Charged Wither Skull

If you manage to vanquish a miniboss, it will dropped a charged skull. Each kind of miniboss drops a different kind of skull: the crimson, warped, or deltary skull.

The skull's mouth and eyes would glow the color of its biome, as an emissive texture. This probably has potential for jumpscares.

You'll need one of each charged skull to make a wither, but you'll also need to locate a fourth structure.

## Soul Withered Shrine

A rarer version of the withered shrine that is only found in the soul sand valley. It's larger and more elaborate, and is mostly made of a new block, reinforced obsidian.

Reinforced obsidian is reinforced with withered bone. It is indestructible to withers, and can only be obtained from the shrine. (Potentially has wall/chain/slab/lantern/brazier variants?) Reinforced obsidian is also pushable, offering many wither-related possibilities.

Placing the three skulls on the soul sand, and then lighting the braziers, will finally summon the wither.

## The Wither

To keep the update feeling fresh and polished, the wither itself has been upgraded as well.

It now has a soul fire-like color scheme, to match its soul-related origin. Its eyes and armor now glow blue.

When it charges up after being spawned. It will emit a beacon beam, as if getting power from some external source. 

The wither has several new attacks. During the first half of the fight, it will alternate between summoning wither skeletons out of the ground and circling you quickly firing black skulls. After the skull attack it will pause long enough for the player to shoot it with a bow. It can only spawn skeletons from soul sand or soil.

After it gets below half health, it will switch to slowly advancing while shooting blue skulls and performing its dash attack. The dash attack would allow it to break through any low strength blocks, while the blue skulls allow it to destroy any attempted shelter.

When it starts getting near zero health, the wither will gradually glow brighter. On death the wither will glow white, shake, and rise into the air for few seconds before exploding and releasing a shockwave that blows through nearby blocks. A nether star is left, floating in the silence.

### Loot

In addition to dropping a nether star, which is no longer affected by gravity, the wither will now drop 200 xp, but the orbs will fly in all directions from the explosion.
