===Undead Update===

==General==

* Husks now spawn in badlands


==Zombie Siege Tweaks==

* During zombie sieges, zombies that spawn in the desert have a chance of being husks, and zombies that spawn in water are drowned

* Zombies that spawn in sieges have a higher chance of having gear, and being able to break doors (hard mode only)

* Each siege will spawn one zombie riding a zombie horse, with gear and a sword. The zombie horse is already tamed


==Drowned Tweaks==

* Drowned no longer have infinite tridents. Instead, they must walk to their trident and pick it up.

* Only the drowned that threw the trident can pick it up.

* The drowned will prioritize attacking the player over retrieving the trident if they are within 3 blocks or have lower than 5 HP

* Drowned will hit the player with the trident instead of throwing if they are within 5 blocks

* Once the drowned has died, the trident may be picked up by anyone

* Drowned can now utilize trident enchantments. For example, a loyalty-enchanted trident will fly back to its owner and a riptide trident will cause the zombie to fly towards its target, but if the drowned is not in water it can only hit the player.

* Tridents now have a 25% chance of disabling a shield as a projectile

* Drowned spawn in dripstone caves


==Wither Skeleton Tweaks==

* Wither skeletons drop wither bones instead of regular bones, but at a lower rate. They still drop coal

* A wither bone can be crafted into 2 wither dust
