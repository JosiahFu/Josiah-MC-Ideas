Repository to dump my Minecraft ideas

## MCW Format
Some of these ideas have been written in Minecraft Wiki page editor, to enhance the visuals.

If you see syntax such as:

    {{Crafting Table
    |A1=Iron Ingot |B1=Iron Ingot |C1=Iron Ingot
    |A2= |B2=Stick |C2=
    |A3= |B3=Stick |C3=
    |Output=Iron Pickaxe
    }}

...That probably means it's in MInecraft Wiki format.

To use it, go to the [Minecraft Wiki Editing Sandbox](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Minecraft_Wiki:Sandbox) and click the edit button. Paste the contents of the text file into the text area and click Show Preview.

Once you're done, you should probably close without saving, but if you really want you can make an anonymous edit. (It is a public sandbox, after all.)
