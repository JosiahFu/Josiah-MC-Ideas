# Wither Expansion

The Wither. It is the source of the all-powerful beacon, but it requires a long grind for skulls, and the fight itself is not very fun. This update aims to mend that.

## Wither Skeleton Skull Piece

The first step is to make the process of acquiring skulls less grindy. Wither skeletons, instead of having a 2% chance of skull drop, will have a 20% chance of dropping one skull piece.

There are 9 unique skull pieces, and you need one of each to craft a single skull. The goal of this is to feel a sense of progress, instead of just rolling the dice until you get a skull, you know you still need a left jaw, a right cheekbone, and a center cranium.

This lowers the average wither skeleton kills per skull to 45 (5 x 9), which seems fair.

## Withered Shrine

Once you've got your three skulls, you can't just place down a wither wherever you want. What fun would that be?

The next step is to find a withered shrine, a new structure that generates in both forests and the basalt deltas. This is intended to promote exploration and make it feel more like an adventure.

The withered shrine is an ancient structure made of obsidian bricks and wither bone blocks. There is a pedestal in the center and four torch-style pillars (basically a soul soil on top of a pillar).

Placing a skull on the center pedestal and lighting all four torches would initiate the miniboss fight.

## Wither Miniboss

> WIP
Name suggestions welcome.

### Charged Wither Skull

If you manage to vanquish a miniboss, it will dropped a charged skull. Each kind of miniboss drops a different kind of skull: the crimson, warped, or deltary skull.

The skull's mouth and eyes would glow the color of its biome, as an emissive texture. This probably has potential for jumpscares.

You'll need one of each charged skull to make a wither, but you'll also need to locate a fourth structure.

## Soul Withered Shrine

A rarer version of the withered shrine that is only found in the soul sand valley. It's larger and more elaborate, and is mostly made of a new block, reinforced obsidian.

Reinforced obsidian is reinforced with withered bone. It is indestructible by withers, and can only be obtained from the shrine. (Potentially has wall/chain/slab/lantern/brazier variants?) Reinforced obsidian is also pushable, offering many wither-related possibilities.

Placing the three skulls on the soul sand, and then lighting the braziers, will finally summon the wither.
