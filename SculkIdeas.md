* Replaces Swift Sneak enchantment
* Perhaps some way to transfer the ability onto another pair of leggings?

    F = Sculk Core Fragement

- Can be inserted into a dead sculk catalyst

## Sculk Core Fragement

- 50% chance of dropping from sculk catalysts
- Can be crafted into sculk cores

## Dead Sculk Catalyst

- Decorative block
- Dropped when a sculk catalyst is mined with silk touch
- Has the same texture as sculk catalyst but does not produce sculk
- When a sculk core is inserted, it will trap sculk charges
- When 32 levels of sculk charge are stored, the catalyst will be activated and converts into a reinforced sculk catalyst

## Reinforced Sculk Catalyst

- Obtained by charging a dead sculk catalyst with an inserted core
- Drops itself when mined even without silk touch
- Can be inserted with another sculk core to give it a chance of creating normal sculk catalysts

# Changes

## Sculk Catalyst

- Has a 50% chance of dropping a sculk core fragement when broken instead of XP
- Drops a dead sculk catalyst when broken with silk touch

## Sculk Shrieker

- When activated by redstone, it will set of any sculk sensors in a 30-block radius
  - Respects wool occlusion
  - Does not summon warden or give blindness effect
  - Lower redstone power levels only transmit to closer sensors

## Sculk Sensor

- When activated by a redstone powered shrieker, it will not send vibrations to nearby shriekers
  - It can still activate another shrieker by redstone power
